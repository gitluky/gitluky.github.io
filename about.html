<p>I graduated from Stony Brook University with a bachelor's degree in Health Science with a concentration in Healthcare Informatics. I have worked as a QA Tester for 5 years with Cognizant Technology Solutions and decided to leave and pursue a career in development.  Join me as I learn how to code. I will routinely post up lessons that I have learned and hopefully they are helpful to you as well.</p>
