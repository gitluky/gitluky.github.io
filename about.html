<p>I've always been a do-it-yourself kind of person. I would never shy away from trying and learning new things with the reason "I don't know how to do it". Nowadays, it's so easy to learn or at least gain some more insight into how you could learn almost anything with a simple google search. Most topics I have had a pleasure to learn about were under the circumstances that...I had to do it. I had to fix the car so my parents could drive it, how to troubleshoot the computers so my family could use it, how to patch up large holes in the drywall because there's a giant hole in the wall of our kitchen, you get the point. One topic that has always intrigued me though, but hadn't had a chance to cross paths with much is programming. How in the world do you tell a machine to do things for you? I graduated from Stony Brook University with a bachelor's degree in Health Science with a concentration in Healthcare Informatics - I wanted to work in healthcare to help people, but my primary choice did not work out so I chose Informatics because of my interest in technology. Right after college, I didn't even work in healthcare, I joined a company that provided business and technology solutions to other businesses, and became a Quality Assurance tester. I was clueless my first day of the job - I had no idea what I was doing, it's scary to think back to how little I knew. But after 5 years of doing it, I became very good at it. I have worked closely with developers and gained an appreciation for what they do.  Hands down I would prefer to be on the side of writing beautiful code and creating software over writing and executing use cases all day. So up to this point, I have just been going with the flow and learning on an as-needed basis. This time I am choosing something that truly interests me, I will learn how to code, but not only how to, but how to do it well. Join me as I learn how to code. I will routinely post up lessons that I have learned and hopefully they are helpful to you as well.</p>
